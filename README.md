JS Preloader


Usage: index.htm is the template, and it is all you need to get started.
All you have to do is to replace the content section (near the bottom) with the content of your webapp / website / webpage, and include JS/CSS further below.

If you are feeling more ambitious, you may simply extract "includes 1-4" and put it into your own html file instead.

See a demo of the JS Preloader in action at http://smokey.simplelittle.com/item_jsloader/

Enjoy!
